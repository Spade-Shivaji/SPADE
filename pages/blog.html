                        <h2>Glasgow Climate Change Conference</h2>
                        <p class="content">The Glasgow Summit officially termed as 2021 United Nations Climate Change
                            Conference or more
                            commonly as COP 26; was hosted by the UK this year from 31st October. <br> The annual
                            conference is held to analyze the progress in
                            tackling Climate Change and try to establish goals to reduce Green House Gas emissions. At
                            COP
                            26, leaders from 190 nations along with experts, researchers, and citizens took part to
                            discuss future plans of action on climate change with the primary aim to finalize rules
                            for the implementation of the Paris Agreement 2016.
                            <span id="para"> <br> COP 26 was announced soon after the assessment report released by
                                the
                                Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Earth’s climate and raises
                                serious concerns
                                regarding the future of humanity.</span><br>

                            COP 26 has tried to address the concerns regarding impeding Climate threats and
                            introduced declarations to tackle them. It is the first time since the Paris Agreement
                            in 2015 that countries are required to upgrade or resubmit their pledges known as
                            <br>
                            Nationally Determined Contributions on tackling emissions of carbon dioxide. The Glasgow
                            agreement has emphasized that stronger action in the current decade was most critical to
                            achieving the 1.5-degree target.
                            <br>
                            Financing such lofty climate goals requires a massive amount of resources. The developed
                            countries are historically obligated to finance Green Projects in developing nations.
                            The developed countries had promised to mobilize at least $100 billion every year from
                            2020 but the deadline has now passed away and the first world has affirmed that they
                            will arrange finance by 2023.
                            <br>
                            <b>Parallel Initiatives:</b>
                            <br>
                            Various countries announced parallel goals that are not part of the official COP
                            discussion. Glasgow Summit certainly has accelerated the efforts of various countries.

                            <b>A.</b> Indian Prime Minister announcement also falls in the same category. India has

                        <h2>RBI Scheme Launch- steps towards inclusiveness</h2>
                        <p class="content">Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated two Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
                            customer-centric initiatives on Friday, named The Retail Direct Scheme and the Reserve Bank
                            Integrated Ombudsman Scheme.
                            <br>
                            The Prime Minister said these programs may broaden the scope of investment in the country
                            and make access to capital markets easier and more secure for investors, promoting financial
                            inclusion. He emphasized the citizen-centric nature of these schemes, saying that the
                            strength and proactiveness of a democracy’s grievance redressal system is the biggest
                            touchstone on any democracy and that the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme will go a long way in
                            that way.
                            <br>
                            The retail direct scheme will allow small investors to receive guaranteed returns by
                            investing in securities and also assisting the government in raising funds for
                            nation-building. The PMO stated that “investors will be able to simply open and maintain
                            their government securities account with the RBI online at no cost.”
                            <br>
                            The governor of the Reserve Bank of India first mentioned the proposal in February 2021. He
                            referred to the scheme as a “major structural transformation.” Investors would need to open
                            and maintain a Retails Direct Gilt Account (RGD) with the RBI to invest in government
                            securities, according to the central bank.
                            <br>
                            Individuals can open an RDG account by filling out an online form and authenticating and
                            submitting the form using the OTP received on their registered mobile and e-mail ID. Payment
                            for the same can be made from the associated bank account via online banking or UPI.
                            <br>
                            The Reserve Bank-Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) aims to improve the grievance
                            resolution procedure for resolving customer complaints against firms regulated by the
                            Central bank. According to the PMO, the scheme is based on the concept of “One Nation, One
                            Ombudsman,” with a single platform, one email address, and one address for customers to
                            complain.
                            <br>
                            The RBI ombudsman scheme’s single national-level integrated digital portal is expected to
                            ensure standardization and a streamlined user-friendly mechanism, adding value to the scheme
                            and bringing customer delight and financial inclusion.
                            <br>
                            He stated that non-performing assets have been identified with transparency in the last
                            seven years, emphasizing that the current government is focused on resolution and recovery.
                            He claims that recapitalization of public sector banks, bringing cooperative banks under
                            RBI’s jurisdiction, and other changes have increased public confidence in the banking
                            system.

                        <h2>DRAFT MEDIATION BILL
                        </h2>
                        <p class="content">On 5th November’21, the Government of India has issued a Draft Mediation Bill
                            for public consultation that has led to the establishment of the Mediation Council of India.
                            The drafted bill proposes for pre-litigation mediation and at the same time safeguards the
                            interest of the litigants to approach the competent adjudicatory forums and courts in case
                            of urgency. According to the draft Bill, the successful outcome of mediation in the form of
                            the Mediation Settlement Agreement has been made enforceable by law. It’s an act to promote
                            and encourage the mediation facility to resolve the disputes that arise between the
                            commercial parties and enforce domestic & international mediation settlements agreements.
                            <br>
                            It’s an online and very cost-effective mediation process. Also, it provides a platform for
                            mediators to register themselves and promote the community of mediation. This practice of
                            mediation has been proven effective for resolving a wide range of problems. Also, it has
                            gained popularity worldwide in solving problems amongst individuals, corporate users,
                            governments, judiciary, lawyers, etc. Since it is a consensual agreement between the
                            parties, the challenge towards the same is on limited grounds. Mediation is a great way to
                            solve traditional legal disputes because party cannot be compelled to participate, except
                            when ordered by Court. Since there’s no set formula for mediation so it’s flexible and
                            there’s no biasness involved.
                            <br>
                            In a nutshell, it’s a great bill that will save time. Also, if we see it through the
                            monetary perspective, it will save money. In addition to this, it’s convenient to use and
                            one doesn’t have to visit the court or anywhere. Companies involved in the case will have
                            equal say. Also, the relationship between the parties have will be preserved.

                            Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe). <br>
                            The development of the policy isn't just on paper but realized, which is evident from the
                            appointment of Pawan Kumar Goenka as Chairperson of IN-SPACE and, the icing on the cake is
                            the announcement of de-regulating the telecommunication sector. But this evidence also came
                            with the conducive framework of law, which isn’t creating a precise model for the actions,
                            responsibilities, and authorities of IN-SPACe.
                            <br>
                            Following and accepting these vulnerabilities in the policy has become a pattern in the past
                            due to the traditional school of thought. These vulnerabilities have led to the turmoil in
                            the Bilateral Investment Treaties which is evident from the past conflicts between the
                            Government of India and other international trade-based countries and organizations.
                            However, that school of thought is beginning to change, and it is evident from the
                            developments in the space sector. <br>
                            The need for a transformation of the Indian space policy landscape goes beyond just the need
                            for creating jobs or for improving tax revenues from the market for space activities. - <br>
                            Ashok G. V.
                            <br>
                            But as a result of understanding the responsibility of development of the primary nation in
                            the critical areas such as defence, space is led in the hands of the private sector,
                            therefore, the key interest shifts to comply with international policies. Our need becomes
                            the development of other nations rather than ours. <br>
                            Whereas with the introduction of the policy, the decision of the space bureaucrats will be
                            assured to be taken under the guidance of policy, and will promise immune to the red-tapism,
                            simultaneously complying with international trade and Investment obligations. More
                            importantly, the brilliant scientist carrying the vision of entrepreneurship will be
                            developing the nation with the sense of perpetual national support with their corroborate,
                            under a policy that complies with the international trade and investment obligations. The
                            policy may turn out to be an effective and powerful tool to achieve the ambition of being a
                            powerful player globally in the space sector.

                        <h2>Air India Disinvestment</h2>
                        <p class="content">The process of divesting Air India has been going since the last decade.
                            Eventually, the ultimate winners are the TATA Sons, the holding company of TATA Group. And
                            ironically, the airlines came back to the Company who started it in 1932. Air India was
                            originally called TATA Airlines in 1932, and in 1946 the name was changed to Air India. The
                            Government owned 49 percent of the holdings at that time but the company was ultimately
                            nationalised in 1953. This wasn’t the first time that the government tried to sell the
                            Airlines. The first attempt was made in May 2000, after which another attempt was made in
                            2017 and now finally the airlines has been officially sold.
                            <br>
                            Some of the reasons why the government wanted to sell the airlines was the sudden rush of
                            low-cost competition with the private airlines entering the market. Air India took a severe
                            hit in both domestic and international markets and also subsequently lost its quality of
                            services and hospitality. In May 2000, there were attempts to sell the Union Government’s
                            stake and the cabinet tried to sell 60% of the government’s shares in the carrier, however
                            it failed due to some reasons. The government desperately tried to keep the carrier alive by
                            doing a merger with Indian Airlines in 2007 and then with a Rs 30,000 crore bailout in 2012.
                            But sadly, none of this worked.
                            <br>
                            The Modi government tried to sell it in 2017–18 but there was no bidder, and it was because
                            the government wanted to hold the minority stake and wanted the bidder to assume the bigger
                            portion of the debt. However, this time the government offered up 100% of its stake and Rs
                            23,000 crores as debt from Rs 60,074 crores. Hence, there are reasons to believe that this
                            Divestment may actually be for the good of Air India and might bring changes for the good in
                            their brand name.
                            <br>
                            <b>Highlights</b>
                            <br>
                            <b>1.</b> TATA Group takes back control of AIR INDIA after 60 years. <br>
                            <b>2. </b> Several failed attempts to sell Air India in the past two decades. <br>
                            <b>3.</b> Air India took a hit after the introduction of private carriers in 1990. <br>

                            <b>4.</b> The Modi government tried to sell Air India in 2017–18 but there were no
                            bidders.<br>
                            <b>5.</b> Finally sold now to TATA SONS. <br>
                            AIR INDIA is now in the great hands of TATA Group.

                        <h2>Decentralized Finance and RBI’s Rising Concern</h2>
                        <p class="content">Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a kind of a blockchain that facilitates a
                            variety of traditional financial services like; insurance, exchanges, lending, borrowing,
                            etc. and has no central authority or someone as an incharge. Services, which earlier were
                            subject to risk of human error are now fully automated and code driven. Hence, open for
                            scrutiny and examination.
                            <br>
                            A circular released by the Apex bank of India, denying the use of crypto was ruled out by
                            the Supreme Court in 2020 and numerous banks including HDFC and State Bank of India made the
                            transactions related to crypto currency official.
                            <br>
                            Consequently, India ranks second among all nations that uses blockchain technology and is
                            expected to grow exponentially in near future. For example, CoinSwitch Kuber is one of the
                            largest crypto platforms in India that has gained approximately 8 million users since June
                            2020. Statistics says that people of age groups between 18–34 years account 40% of the total
                            blockchains adopted.
                            <br>
                            Many experts support Defi’s ability to positively impact various aspects of India, including
                            improvement of the country’s financial infrastructure, curbing financial frauds, great
                            incentives for foreign investments, more job opportunities, building up the monetary policy
                            and the endless potential of DeFi’s growth and expansion. However, the central bank
                            continues to have major concerns regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
                            <br>
                            Private cryptocurrencies are said to be unregulated, involve complex processes and are
                            highly volatile. El Salvador is the first country to announce crypto as a legal tender but
                            currently it is in a state of financial unrest with a 20% corrected value in a single day.
                            <br>
                            Considering all these facts and EL Salvador’s case, the RBI is dreading the scenario of
                            dependence on an unregulated tender of currency and a possible financial instability in the
                            country. Therefore, red flagged the government to ponder before passing any order.
                            <br>
                            Plus, India itself is focusing on developing its own digital rupee and trials for the same
                            are anticipated to be made later in this year. The in-process digital rupee will be
                            centralised and well regulated by the Apex bank and the government of India.
                            <br>
                            <b> Highlights -</b> <br>
                            <i><b> DeFi is a term given to financial services that are not regulated by any central
                                    authority. <br>
                                    Honourable SC of India discarded RBI’s ban on DeFi in 2020, which has kickstarted
                                    India’s journey for becoming a crypto hub. <br>
                                    Supporters empower crypto in the limelight of the positive benefits it could reap
                                    for the country; however, the critics disregard it as opaque. <br>
                                    Considering crypto’s zero regulation, high volatility and complex mining, RBI dreads
                                    the negative repercussions it could have as a legal tender. <br>
                                </b></i>
                            Development of India’s own digital rupee is under process, and unlike Defi, it will
                            be regulated by the Apex Bank of India.

                        <h2>FASTER System</h2>
                        <p class="content">On 23rd September’21, the Supreme Court of India implemented a system known
                            as the FASTER system that stands for Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records.
                            <br>
                            It’s a system that helps in accelerating the process of transferring e-authenticated copies
                            from courts to prisons. This system is implemented to reduce the delays that pop up at the
                            time of interim orders, stay orders, bail orders and, records of proceedings of prisoners.
                            <br>
                            Through this system, the courts can send the instructions via a secured e-communication
                            system to the officers at duty in the prisons. An E-communication system will help in the
                            smooth flow of execution and non-execution of orders from the court. <br>

                            Article 21 will be maintained effectively and efficiently that says, “No person shall be
                            deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by
                            law”. <br> Before this system was implemented, the unconvicted prisoners that were in jail
                            had to
                            wait for days for the orders of the court to prison, asking them to show up in the court for
                            the trial for their offense. As there are always two sides of the same coin; therefore, the
                            only problem that can arise is of giving internet facilities to all the 1350 jails
                            (according to 2019 data), and also, it can lead to the outspread of critical information
                            from behind the bars.
                            <br>
                            However, implementation of the FASTER system is a good step towards an Eco-friendly
                            Environment. Considering the data,11 billion sheets (approx.) are being used by the Indian
                            judiciary every year out of which, say 0.5% of these sheets are used in these courts for
                            prison bail, interim order, documents, etc., <br> so as a result of the implementation of
                            this
                            system, roughly it can save up to 40 lacks sheets per year which will indirectly help in
                            conserving trees.
